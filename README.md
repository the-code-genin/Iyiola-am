### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I'm a software engineer specializing in building and deploying web apps, server-side, and CLI software primarily with the JS/TS, and Go programming languages. I have hands-on experience building web3 applications/platforms by leveraging various technologies like the blockchain and IPFS. I also have some proficiency in DevOps. In my free time, I like trying my hand at new and emerging tech.

I build, deploy and manage software solutions for individuals and corporate bodies to leverage the power of modern technology to optimize their business operations and scale in the digital space.
