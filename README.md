### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I am a software developer with a focus on developing enterprise, high-performance, and distributed software systems. I am keenly interested in data science and its applications in quantitative finance and machine learning.

I work primarily with the Go and JS/TS (server-side and web) programming languages. I also have experience with PHP, C, and Python.

You can follow me on Twitter [@the_code_genin](https://twitter.com/the_code_genin)! I post informative stuff there from time to time... and why not?ðŸ˜„
