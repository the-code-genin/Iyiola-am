### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I am a software engineer with over 5 years of professional experience in developing enterprise software with a focus on the backend/server side. I work primarily with the Go and Typescript (NodeJS & React/Next) programming languages, but I have experience with PHP and C as well.

You can follow me on Twitter [@the_code_genin](https://twitter.com/the_code_genin)! I post informative stuff there from time to time... and why not?ðŸ˜„
