### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I am a software developer with over 5 years of professional experience with a focus on developing enterprise, high-performance, and distributed software systems.

I work primarily with the Go and Typescript (NodeJS & React/Next) programming languages, but I have experience with PHP and C as well.

You can follow me on Twitter [@the_code_genin](https://twitter.com/the_code_genin)! I post informative stuff there from time to time... and why not?ðŸ˜„
