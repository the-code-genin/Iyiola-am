### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I'm a software engineer specializing in building and deploying web apps and server-side/CLI software primarily with the JS/TS, Go and PHP programming languages. I also have hands-on experience building web3 applications/platforms by leveraging various technologies like the blockchain and IPFS. In my free time, I like trying my hand at new and emerging tech.

You can follow me on twitter [@the_code_genin](https://twitter.com/the_code_genin)! I post informative stuff there from time to time... and why not?ðŸ˜„
