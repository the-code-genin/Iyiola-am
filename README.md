### Hello there! I'm Mohammed Adekunle.

I'm a software engineer with over 5 years of experience in architecting, building, and deploying backend services and cloud systems. I also have professional experience in building and architecting web apps and decentralized software systems. I like trying my hand at new and emerging tech in my free time.

You can follow me on twitter [@the_code_genin](https://twitter.com/the_code_genin)! I post informative stuff there from time to time... and why not?ðŸ˜„
